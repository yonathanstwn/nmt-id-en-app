# Neural Machine Translation Indonesian-English App
Neural Machine Translation Indonesian-English University Final Year Project with a focus in producing the first-ever high quality large scale English to colloquial Indonesian NMT model called EColIndo. We also provide the first-ever large scale dataset for this pair and it is fully auto-generated by ChatGPT.

# Overview
The repository can be seen to have three main parts:
- `Transformers` contains all the training-related code.
- `Scraper` contains the generation part of the parallel English to colloquial Indonesian corpus.
- `WebApp`, `TrainAPI`, `InferenceAPI` are the three microservices that demonstrates the resulting fine-tuned NMT models, specifically EColIndo.

# Environment
Python version: Python 3.7.4

List of packages are found in requirements.txt and can be installed with:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Please ensure Python version is the same.

# Web Application
To run the web app, you need to run the three Django microservices locally. Ensure you have installed all requirements and activated the virtual environment.
Please follow the steps:
```
cd WebApp
python manage.py runserver
cd ..
cd InferenceAPI
python manage.py runserver 8001
cd ..
